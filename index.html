<h3>Why Take programming?</h3>
<div class="colum">
<p>Different people have got different reasons as for taking or pursuing programming. I for one have always had the urge to understand how the computer commuhnicates with its users. The desire to understand what happens in the back-end of a computer is my key motivation to try and learn programming.</p>
<p>As a result I enrolled to Moringa school to fulfill my dream and so far the journey has been rewarding. Here is a link to some of the work I have tried working on. <a href="favorite-things.html"> favorite things</a>.</p>
